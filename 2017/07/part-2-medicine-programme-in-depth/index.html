<p>Unlike other courses in UBD except for Chemical &amp; Process engineering, Medicine has a fixed compulsory modules(subjects). Therefore, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the timetable/exam clashes. Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t take other non-compulsory breath modules (i.e Languages, Economics and etc). Your schedule is already tight and taking other breath modules is insane! <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sp4vRQr.png">This is what the timetable looks like</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="tl-dr">Tl;dr</h2>

<ul>
<li>Busy life</li>
<li>Many things to study</li>
<li>You get to talk with real patients</li>
<li>Exam is fucking tough</li>
<li>Medicine is not for everyone</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="medicine-modules">Medicine Modules:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Health Sciences (HS)</li>
<li>Our Community and Professional Personal Developement (OC/PPD)</li>
<li>Special Study Module (SSM)</li>
<li>Patient Care (PC)</li>
<li>Clinical Placement (3rd year only)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compulsory-breath-modules">Compulsory breath modules:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Melayu Islam Beraja</li>
<li>Islamic Civilisation (Taught in english)</li>
<li>Communication Skills I &amp; II (aka English language)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="health-sciences">Health Sciences</h4>

<ul>
<li>Basic Sciences</li>
<li>Clinical Sciences</li>
</ul>

<p>PBL is part of the Health Sciences module, as the LOBS that you&rsquo;ve learned will definitely come out in exam. Health Sciences is the toughest exam when compared to other Medicine modules. There are so many things to learn (14 cases/systems in 1 semester or 14 weeks), so time management and dedication to studying is important! People drop out of the course because of this module.</p>

<h4 id="oc-ppd">OC/PPD</h4>

<ul>
<li>Ethics, Law, Teamwork, Islamic Medicine, Audit</li>
<li>Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Research methods, Evidence Based Medicine</li>
</ul>

<p>OC as the name implies, is all about <strong>Brunei community health</strong> and what health services that are available to tackle these community problems.</p>

<p>PPD, is where you get to learn all the <strong>medical laws, ethics, biostatistics and islamic medicine</strong>. <em>An example, <a href="https://omarkasule-tib.blogspot.com/2011/06/diabetes-and-puasa.html">can a diabetic patient fast?</a></em>(Yes we actually use Dr.Omar Kasule Notes).</p>

<h4 id="patient-care">Patient Care</h4>

<p>This module teaches your <strong>practical &amp; communication skills</strong> with patients on how to take a <strong>history</strong> (What&rsquo;s their complain?), <strong>examinations</strong> (Neurological, Abdominal, Cardiovascular and more) and also <strong>procedures</strong> (stitching, Urethral catherisation). This skills are very important, as you will apply all those skills during your clinical visit/attachment in RIPAS which is conducted <strong>once a week for 1st &amp; 2nd years and twice a week for 3rd years</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="special-study-module">Special Study Module</h4>

<p>For each year, the SSM module will be different.</p>

<p><strong>1st year (SSM1)</strong>, follow up a pregnant woman until delivery and write a full report (5 sections = 5000 words)</p>

<p><strong>2nd year (SSM2)</strong>, do any research; requires ethical approval from both IHS Research Ethics Committee &amp; Ministry of Health Research Ethics Committe to actually conduct the research. You even get to publish or even present in a symposium if your research is really good.</p>

<p><strong>3rd year (SSM3)</strong>, conduct a community programme; An example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/liftin.bn">L.I.F.T.I.N</a>.</p>

<h4 id="clinical-placement">Clinical Placement</h4>

<p>This module is only for 3rd years and you are required to do at least <strong>40 clinical skills</strong> in the hospital, record a <strong>10 minute video</strong> of you interviewing a real patient and write a total of <strong>6 reflective portfolio</strong>.</p>

<p>Clinical skills including doing vene-puncture on real patients (Taking blood!), Male Urethral catherisation (Insert tubes into their dick!) and sponge-bathing a patient (Whew! Respect to all the staffs doing this everyday!).</p>

<p>Yes, you need to record a video of you taking a history from a real patient so you need to find patients in the wards and ask for permission! Some patient are talktative so you need control them &gt;.&lt; due to time limitation.</p>

<p>Reflective portfolio is basically writing at least 100 words on the problem you&rsquo;ve encountered during your clinical visits/attachment and what you can learn from them. The porfolio are written based on a list of topic given to you in the beginning of year, i.e <em>Ethical practise and legal responsibilities</em> and <em>Memorable patients</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-s-medicine-taught-in-brunei">How&rsquo;s Medicine taught in Brunei?</h2>

<p>Medicine in Brunei are taught with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning">Problem Based Learning</a> + Lecture</strong>, like most UK medical schools. In the 1st year also known as foundation year, all 5 available courses in IHS are taught together which includes both lectures and PBL.</p>

<p>In the 2nd &amp; 3rd year, PBL is only held for medical students. By this time, you are already expert in PBLing.</p>

<h3 id="how-s-problem-based-learning-conducted">How&rsquo;s Problem Based Learning conducted?</h3>

<p>Basically, you will be given a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/woiYThD.png">patient&rsquo;s case</a> and you have to <strong><em>discuss</em></strong> with your mates about the patient&rsquo;s problem. As you discuss, you might come across unknown words or even <strong><em>wtf is wrong with the patient</em></strong>. All these questions goes under <strong><em>Learning Objectives(LOBS)</em></strong> for you to <strong>learn</strong> (either through lectures, books or internet) and <strong>present</strong> in the next PBL session.</p>

<p>From PBL, you are going to learn all your <strong>basic sciences</strong> intensively. For an example, you learn <strong><em>Gastrointestinal system</em></strong> (including related GI diseases) within approximately 2 weeks, which is fucking insane! Each week, the theme of the case will be different. Below is just a rough example.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Week</th>
<th align="center">Case</th>
<th align="right">System</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td align="center">Colorectal Cancer</td>
<td align="right">Oncology</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td align="center">Respiratory distress of infancy</td>
<td align="right">Paediatrics</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td align="center">Depression</td>
<td align="right">Psychiatric</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="basic-sciences-not-for-the-faint-of-heart">Basic Sciences (NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!!)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Anatomy &amp; Physiology</li>
<li>Microbiology</li>
<li>Biochemistry</li>
<li>Pharmacology</li>
<li>Clinical diseases</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-to-discuss-in-pbl">What to discuss in PBL?</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Questions to ask the patient</p>

<p>Hypothesis on the disease</p>

<p>Investigations &amp; Examinations to conduct</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most people&rsquo;s opinion, PBL is an efficient method to study when compared to lectures only. Teaching others what you know is a really good way to judge your own knowledge. Personally, i prefer Anki (Spaced-memory repetition is the best) and sometimes i skipped lectures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I hear and I forget.”</p>

<p>“I see and I remember.”</p>

<p>“I do and I understand.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-about-the-exams">What about the exams??</h2>

<p>There are 2 papers and 1 Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE).</p>

<p><strong>Health Science paper</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>100 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) and 5 Short Answer Questions (SAQ) for 3 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>EVERTHING CUM OUT! <em>&lsquo;Nuff said</em></p>

<p><strong>OC/PPD paper</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>20 SAQ for 3 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p>Memorise the shit out of all the slides and notes given to you and KONPOM 99.9% A*!</p>

<p><strong>OSCE</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>10 stations; 1 station = 7 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>DON&rsquo;T BE AN ASSHOLE. There are 30 of you so BE POLITE TO THE SIMULATED PATIENTS (No real patients or is it?).</p>

<p>PRACTISE ALL THOSE SKILLS WITH YOUR FRIENDS. They are graded based on the average performance of your course-mate.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-failed-the-exams">What if i failed the exams??</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, it is quite common for people to fail Medicine including who have CRAZYSMARTASS A-LEVEL GRADES. The passing mark is 60% (Grade C). Trying to achieve a pass is already a great achievement! You can only do supplementary exam once which will be 3 weeks (i think?) after results are out.</p>

<p>Year 1</p>

<ul>
<li>Dropped out of the programme if failed supplementary exam</li>
<li>Repetition of module is not allowed</li>
<li>Change to another programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Year 2 &amp; 3</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a chance to repeat failed module and continue to 4th year after failing supplementary exam</li>
<li>Repeated students are now allowed to proceed to PMS</li>
<li>Change to another programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, when you&rsquo;ve failed the supplementary exam in the 2nd or 3rd year, you will not be able to get your Medical Degree. In other words, you cannot be a medical doctor. In this case, you will continue to 4th year and do another research (Same as SSM2) to complete your study (BHSc Medicine, but no medical license).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="extra-curriculum-events">Extra-curriculum events</h2>

<p>There are a handful of event that you should join and volunteer. They are good for your experience!</p>

<ul>
<li>International Summer Medical School (Kagawa University, Japan)</li>
<li>International Winter Medical School (Kagawa University, Japan)</li>
<li>Universitas Malaysia Sabah Anatomy Workshop</li>
<li>Malaysia-Indonesia-Brunei Medical Conference</li>
<li>Regional Inter-university Physiology Quiz Competition</li>
<li>University or Faculty Student Council</li>
<li>Health checks</li>
<li>Blood donation drives and other charity drives</li>
<li>Sport events</li>
</ul>

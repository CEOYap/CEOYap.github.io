      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studying Medicine is indeed tough, even for straight A&amp;rsquo;s students. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve entered a medical school, your previous &amp;ldquo;amazing&amp;rdquo; grades doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean shit at all. I am pretty sure you&amp;rsquo;ve realised that by now, after reading this. Everyone who&amp;rsquo;ve entered medical school are clever, but are they a great learner or teacher?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve finally graduated from university! Time to use my spare time developing this game. Onwards to the new update, i&amp;rsquo;ve finally added all the heroes from DOTA 2 with all the required stats. It&amp;rsquo;s now in a playable state but it still require some serious work on the stats.

Beside that, i&amp;rsquo;ve made a new design to the card and created a website specifically for &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ceoyap.github.io/D2CCG.htm&#34;&gt;DOTA2-CCG&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, which can also be accessed from the sidebar menu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A simple free CCG using Unreal Engine that has the same ruleset as Hearthstone so that the game will be easy for newbies to pickup.

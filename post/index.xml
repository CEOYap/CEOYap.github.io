      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have seen x265 releases in the net and be suprised with the quality and size of those movies/tv-shows compared to the old x264. You might be wondering - How do i encode all those Blu-rays i got into x265 for storage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when Handbrake comes in handy! You can easily encode any movies into x265 or even other formats (i.e mp4, mkv, mov and etc).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 5 of the series on &amp;ldquo;Thinking Inside the Box: A Complete EQ Tutorial&amp;rdquo; were authored by the user “hipnotic”  (Steve Mercer) and originally hosted and rehosted at the now defunct dnbscene.com &amp;amp; apexaudio.org respectively. I think this is the best well-explained EQ tutorial ever made, it would be a shame for it to go to waste. I hope readers will benefit from this guide. There are slight differences from the original article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to survive Medical School?</title>
      <link>https://ceoyap.github.io/2017/07/how-to-survive-medical-school/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Studying Medicine is indeed tough, even for straight A&amp;rsquo;s students. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve entered a medical school, your previous &amp;ldquo;amazing&amp;rdquo; grades doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean shit at all. I am pretty sure you&amp;rsquo;ve realised that by now, after reading this. Everyone who&amp;rsquo;ve entered medical school are clever, but are they a great learner or teacher?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Onwards to the new update, i&amp;rsquo;ve finally added all the heroes from DOTA 2 with all the required stats. It&amp;rsquo;s now in a playable state but it still require some serious work on the stats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
